<h3>First things first</h3>\n            First things first, you need a little introduction to the topic. The guild app is a social app created to make networking easier. It is available both on computers and mobile phones. Its website can be seen under this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://guild.co\">link</a>. The main feature of the application is the ability to create and join groups. Groups usually focus on business-related topics or users' interests. Within groups, users can create threads, polls, events, or video calls. While working at Monterail Software House, I had the opportunity to design new features for the Guild app and redesign old ones. I was part of a scrum team consisting of a Product Manager, two Developers (one responsible for front-end and one for back-end), one QA, and me - Product Designer. We were also in frequent contact with the CEO of Guild - Gregor Young.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My work on the new poll conversation feature began when Gregor informed me that users lack space to discuss poll results. He said that users create a separate conversation for this purpose, but this way poll and conversation are not connected in any way. Gregor asked for my help in solving this issue. Okay, now you know the basics!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <h3>The first step and first failure</h3>\n            My first step was to look through the patterns existing on the market. I observed how polls typically look in social media applications. After a brief research phase, my initial idea was to allow users to create polls within conversations, similar to how it is done on the Messenger app or Slack. This way, discussions about poll results could take place within the conversation, and both elements would be connected, forming a cohesive whole. However, this idea turned out to be a non-starter due to technical reasons and was rejected at an early stage.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <h3>Getting on the right track</h3>\n            After the initial setback, I continued to brainstorm and came up with another idea. I wanted to give users the option to create a dedicated conversation when creating a new poll. I called it a poll conversation. On poll conversation, users could discuss the poll and its results. This conversation would be connected directly with the poll. Before diving into the designs to ensure I was heading in the right direction and not wasting time on designing the wrong solution, I discussed my idea with the development team and Gregor (Guild CEO). The idea received positive feedback, with only one new requirement: Gregor wanted users to have access to the conversation only after taking part in the poll, so they wouldn't be influenced by others' comments while answering the survey.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <h3>Design Process</h3>\n            After the meeting, I had a clear design flow in my mind, so I started sketching it in Figma. I began by making changes to the poll creation process. I added a checkbox on the poll creation screen. If the user leaves it checked in, a poll conversation will be created instead of a regular poll. I also added a tooltip to the checkbox, explaining what the new option is and how it works. Below, on the carousel, you can see how the poll conversation creation flow looks in the desktop app.\n            <Carousel>\n                <img src={guild_1} alt=\"guild_1\"/>\n                <img src={guild_2} alt=\"guild_2\"/>\n                <img src={guild_3} alt=\"guild_3\"/>\n                <img src={guild_4} alt=\"guild_4\"/>\n                <img src={guild_5} alt=\"guild_5\"/>\n                <img src={guild_6} alt=\"guild_6\"/>\n            </Carousel>\n            After finishing the design for the poll conversation creation flow, I moved on to the flow of answering poll questions. It was already in place, but I felt it could look better visually, so I decided to give it a fresh look. I felt that in the current design, all the elements were quite large, which could lead to users having to scroll the screen if the question would be longer or if there would be more possible answers. I wanted to avoid this situation, so I reduced the size of all the elements. Below, you can see how mobile screens, showing the flow of answering the poll, looked before and after I made some changes.\n            <Carousel>\n                <img src={guild_7} alt=\"guild_7\"/>\n                <img src={guild_8} alt=\"guild_8\"/>\n                <img className=\"desktop_only\" src={guild_8_desktop} alt=\"guild_8_desktop\"/>\n            </Carousel>\n        </p>\n\n    </ProjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Index;\n"],"names":["guildProject","getProject","React","ProjectPage","project","target","href","Carousel","src","guild_1","alt","guild_2","guild_3","guild_4","guild_5","guild_6","guild_7","guild_8","className","guild_8_desktop"],"sourceRoot":""}
