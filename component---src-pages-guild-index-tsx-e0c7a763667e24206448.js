Groups usually focus on business-related topics or users' interests. Within groups, users can create threads, polls, events, or video calls. While working at Monterail Software House, I had the opportunity to design new features for the Guild app and redesign old ones.

This conversation would be connected directly with the poll. Before diving into the designs to ensure I was heading in the right direction and not wasting time on designing the wrong solution, I discussed my idea with the development team and Gregor (Guild CEO).

The design of the thread on the group feed included the beginning of the last comment and the avatar of the person who wrote it. I knew that we couldn't apply the exact same pattern, or at least not in every case, as one of the business requirements was to keep comments on poll conversations hidden from users who did not participate in the poll. There was also the question of whose avatar to show when there are no comments in the poll conversation yet.
