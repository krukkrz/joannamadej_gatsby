Groups usually focus on business-related topics or users' interests. Within groups, users can create threads, polls, events, or video calls. While working at Monterail Software House, I had the opportunity to design new features for the Guild app and redesign old ones. I was part of a scrum team consisting of a Product Manager, two Developers (one responsible for front-end and one for back-end), one QA, and me - Product Designer. We were also in frequent contact with the CEO of Guild - Gregor Young."),p.createElement("p",null,"My work on the new poll conversation feature began when Gregor informed me that users lack space to discuss poll results.

I observed how polls typically look in social media applications. After a brief research phase, my initial idea was to allow users to create polls within conversations, similar to how it is done on the Messenger app or Slack. This way, discussions about poll results could take place within the conversation, and both elements would be connected, forming a cohesive whole. However, this idea turned out to be a non-starter due to technical reasons and was rejected at an early stage."),p.createElement("p",null,p.createElement("h3",null,"Getting on the right track"),"After the initial setback, I continued to brainstorm and came up with another idea. I wanted to give users the option to create a dedicated conversation when creating a new poll. I called it a poll conversation. On poll conversation, users could discuss the poll and its results. This conversation would be connected directly with the poll. Before diving into the designs to ensure I was heading in the right direction and not wasting time on designing the wrong solution, I discussed my idea with the development team and Gregor (Guild CEO). The idea received positive feedback, with only one new requirement: Gregor wanted users to have access to the conversation only after taking part in the poll, so they wouldn't be influenced by others' comments while answering the survey."),p.createElement("p",null,p.createElement("h3",null,"Design Process"),"After the meeting, I had a clear design flow in my mind, so I started sketching it in Figma. I began by making changes to the poll creation process. I added a checkbox on the poll creation screen.

It was already in place, but I felt it could look better visually, so I decided to give it a fresh look. I felt that in the current design, all the elements were quite large, which could lead to users having to scroll the screen if the question would be longer or if there would be more possible answers. I wanted to avoid this situation, so I reduced the size of all the elements.
